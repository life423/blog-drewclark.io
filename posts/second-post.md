# Next.js Basics

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications simple and efficient.

## Why Next.js?

1. **Server-side rendering** - Better SEO and performance
2. **File-based routing** - Intuitive way to create pages
3. **API Routes** - Build backend functionality right in your Next.js app

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js app, you can run:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

And that's it! Your app will be running at http://localhost:3000.
